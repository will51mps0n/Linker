# Linker

This project implements a **multi-file linker** for a simulated architecture. The linker combines multiple object files into a single machine code program, resolving label references, adjusting for relocation, and validating symbol tables. It mirrors the behavior of traditional linkers in low-level systems.

---

## Features

- Parses `.obj` files containing sections (text, data, symbol table, relocation table)
- Resolves global and local labels across files
- Applies relocation to instructions like `lw`, `sw`, and `.fill`
- Outputs linked machine code (`.mc` file) for simulation
- Validates symbol definitions, detects redefinitions and undefined symbols

---

##  Building

make clean
make linker

---

## Run all regression tests:
./runtests.sh

This:
Runs the linker on multiple test suites
Compares actual .mc output to .txt or .correct files
Prints pass/fail diffs to help debug

---

## Example Manual Usage
./linker Linker_Tests/t2_0.obj Linker_Tests/t2_1.obj Linker_Tests/t2_2.obj output.mc
diff output.mc Linker_Tests/t2c.txt

---

## Notes
Object files are generated by a separate LC-2K assembler
Labels like Stack must remain undefined in all object files
Up to 6 object files are supported per link (per Makefile logic)
